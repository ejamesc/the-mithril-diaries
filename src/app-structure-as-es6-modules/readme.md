# app-structure-as-es6-modules

Demo of our [BELAS](https://github.com/pakx/the-mithril-diaries/wiki/Basic-App-Structure) app structure as ES6 modules.

## Installation

Clone this repo, then `npm install`

## Notes

In this demo we structure our [BELAS](https://github.com/pakx/the-mithril-diaries/wiki/Basic-App-Structure) app structure as ES6 modules, bundled using Rollup, with Mithril itself still served from a CDN.

Rollup setup mostly follows what's laid out in this excellent [article](https://code.lengstorf.com/learn-rollup-js/). This demo does not include Babel, linting, file-watching, or hot-reloading (all of which are also described in the article).
